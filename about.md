Hi, my name is Etienne Koekemoer and this is my personal website.

I am the proud father of two gorgeous daughters and the loving husband of a beautiful wife.

I am proud to call South Africa my home and I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer in one of Africa's biggest banks.

In my spare time, I like to code and work on a few personal projects. You can see most of these personal projects of mine on my [Github page](https://github.com/EtienneK).

I am also an avid Gamer and enjoy Video- as well as Board games. You can view my current [collection of board games on BoardGameGeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/EtienneK?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1).
