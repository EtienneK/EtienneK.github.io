![Lords of Waterdeep]({{ site.url }}/assets/pictures/board-games/lords-of-waterdeep.jpeg)

It was my board game group's weekly get-together last night and we played some [Lords of Waterdeep][lowd] with the [Scoundrels of Skullport][sosp] expansion.

Lords of Waterdeep is a [worker placement][wp] game set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe.

Out of the four of us who played, only I have played it before. This meant there were some hiccups with some of the players not understanding some of the cards and getting some of the rules wrong. Nonetheless, the game moved at a steady pace and we were done in about 2 hours. 

I ended up winning after completing a massive 40 point quest and scoring lots of points at the end of the game for all the buildings I've built.

We all had fun and everyone said they would play it again - one even said he's going to buy it for himself.

Even though the game is more than 4 years old, it still holds up - especially if you add the expansion. It's one of the few games in my collection I will probably never get tired of. It works with new and experienced gamers and I always have a blast playing it.

Highly recommended!
