So this is my first post. First of many, hopefully!

I've tried blogging before, but it just never stuck. Hopefully this time is different!

The reason I started this blog is because I really wanted to start writing again. I used to write a lot when I was in high-school, but for some reason I just stopped. So now, with the new year, one of my resolutions was to start writing again. And here we are.

So let's hope this time it sticks!
