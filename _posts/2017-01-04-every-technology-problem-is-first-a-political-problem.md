In June 2016, [Jeff Hackert][jeff-hackert-linkedin] (used to work at [Riot Games][riot-games] and [Chef][chef]), spent an hour to give us a very general talk about software engineering culture and some general management insights when dealing with software engineers. One of his slides, which I will never forget, stood out to me. It read:

> Every technology problem is first a political problem.

I have started slowly moving into a more senior role in the software engineering profession. And as I've grown, I have come to realise that dealing with people effectively is crucial - especially in the beginning of a project when there are many different voices and opinions; and especially if the project touches many existing functional areas and systems.

When you start working on a project that has the potential to make a big impact on the entire organization, everyone wants to be part of it. This creates a lot of noise. Different people want different things out of the project. Everyone wants their requirements and opinions to be treated as equal - some more equal than others.

Thus, before even thinking of system implementation details, you will need to communicate with a lot of people. And you will need to filter through the noise to be able to get to the core of the problem you are trying to solve.

Technology is not easy. And putting a layer of unavoidable politics on top if it makes it that much more difficult.
