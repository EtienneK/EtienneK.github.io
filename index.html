            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hi there! My name is Etienne Koekemoer and this is my personal website.</p>

            <p>I am the proud father of two gorgeous daughters and the loving husband of a beautiful wife.</p>

            <p>Most of my professional career has been spent designing and building Information Technology systems,
                primarily in the Banking domain. Crafting systems and applications that make peoples' lives better is my
                passion.</p>

            <p>In my spare time, I like to code and work on a few personal projects. You can see most of these personal
                projects of mine on my <a href="https://github.com/EtienneK">Github</a> page.</p>

            <p>I am also an avid Gamer and enjoy Video- as well as Board games. You can view my <a
                    href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/EtienneK">current collection of
                    board games on BoardGameGeek.com</a>.</p>
